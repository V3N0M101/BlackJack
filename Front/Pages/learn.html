          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Blackjack is a single-deck game where one or more players play against a dealer. It's simple: defeat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Each player plays only against the dealer—not the other players.</p>
          <p>Queens, Jacks, and Kings are worth 10; number cards are worth face value; and Aces are worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more beneficial.</p>
          <p>Blackjack is a game of decision-making—knowing when to hit, stand, double down, or split based on odds and the dealer's visible card.</p>

          <h2>Rules</h2>

          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>Beat the dealer by having a hand total closer to 21 without going over (busting).</p>

          <h3>Card Values</h3>
          <img src="../Images/Learn/Blackjack-values.png" alt="Blackjack card values" class="centered-image" />

          <h3>Basic Gameplay and Terminology</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Place a Bet:</strong> All players place their bets before cards are dealt.</li>
            <li><strong>Deal:</strong> Two cards go to each player and the dealer.</li>
            <li><strong>Player’s Cards:</strong> Face-up. Dealer has one face-up and one face-down card.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Player Actions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Draw another card.</li>
            <li><strong>Stand:</strong> Keep your current hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your bet and take one final card.</li>
            <li><strong>Split:</strong> If you have two of the same card, split them into two hands.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dealer’s Turn</h3>
          <p>The dealer reveals their hidden card and hits until reaching 17 or more. In some casinos, the dealer must hit on a “soft 17.”</p>

          <h3>Winning</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You win if your hand is higher than the dealer's without busting.</li>
            <li>You win if the dealer busts and you don't.</li>
            <li>You lose if you bust, no matter the dealer’s hand.</li>
            <li>If tied, it’s a “push” and your bet is returned.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Examples</h2>

  <h3>Example 1: Natural Blackjack</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> Ace ♠️ + King ♥️ → 21</p>
  <p><strong>Dealer:</strong> 10 ♣️ + 7 ♦️ → 17</p>
  <p>You win outright with a Blackjack and are paid typically 3:2.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>Example 2: Hitting or Standing</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> 10 ♥️ + 6 ♦️ → 16</p>
  <p><strong>Dealer reveals:</strong> 10 ♠️</p>
  <p>It's not a good idea, but most fundamental strategies call for hitting since the dealer has a strong upcard and you will likely lose if they hit a stronger combination.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>Example 3: Splitting</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> 8 ♥️ + 8 ♦️ → 16</p>
  <p><strong>Dealer shows:</strong> 6 ♠️</p>
  <p>You split the 8s into two hands, hoping to have strong hands from each. This is the correct decision since the dealer shows a weak card.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>Example 4: Double Down</h3>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> 5 ♣️ + 6 ♦️ → 11</p>
  <p><strong>Dealer shows:</strong> 4 ♥️</p>
  <p>You double down, bet more and receive one card. Luckily, you get a 10 to get to 21.</p>

          <h2>Tips</h2>

  <h3>1. Know Basic Strategy</h3>
  <p>There is a mathematically established way of playing every conceivable hand based on your count and the dealer's upcard. Reading and following a basic strategy chart lowers the house edge.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>2. Always Split Aces and Eights</h3>
  <p>Aces give you a good chance to get 21.</p>
  <p>Eights split up a poor hand (16) into two potentially improved hands.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>3. Never Split Tens or Fives</h3>
  <p>Fives make a good 10—better to double down.</p>
  <p>Tens give you 20, a good hand not to break up.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>4. Don't Take Insurance</h3>
  <p>If the dealer has an Ace, they will occasionally offer you "insurance." It's actually a side bet that the dealer has blackjack. It's against the odds for you, and everyone agrees that you don't want to take it.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>5. Watch the Dealer's Upcard</h3>
  <p>When the dealer shows a 2–6, they will probably bust, so be careful.</p>
  <p>When the dealer shows a 7–Ace, bet aggressively.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>6. Master Bankroll Management</h3>
  <p>Risk only what you can lose. Set a budget and stick to it. Never chase losses.</p>

  <br />
  <hr />
  <br />

  <h3>7. Stay Cool and Steady</h3>
  <p>Blackjack is a game of runs. Stick with your strategy even in case of losses—it will show returns eventually.</p>
  <p>With practice of the fundamentals and rehearsal of sound decision-making, blackjack is not luck—it is a skill game you can play and master. Play small, play responsibly, and have fun!</p>
